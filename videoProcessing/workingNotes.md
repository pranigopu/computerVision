# Packages useful for video processing
## `ffmpeg-python` (imported as `ffmpeg`)
FFmpeg (Fast Forward Moving Picture Experts Group) is a free and open source software project containing a suite of libraries and programs for handling (i.e. recording, converting and streaming) multimedia files, i.e. video and audio files. `ffmpeg-python` in Python is a [Python binding](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/definitions#language-binding) for FFmpeg. Note that `python-ffmpeg` (also imported as `ffmpeg`) is another Python binding for FFmpeg. Both bindings provide [synchronous and asynchronous APIs](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/definitions#api). To install `ffmpeg-python`, enter `pip install ffmpeg-python` in the terminal/command prompt.

**NOTE**: _Installing both_ `ffmpeg-python` _and_ `python-ffmpeg` _is ill-advised since both are identified during imports as_ `ffmpeg` _(which means you would be using only the first Python binding installed). If you have one installed but want to switch to another, uninstall the one you currently have first._

## `subprocess`
A built-in module in Python that allows you to spawn child processes (subprocesses), connect to their input/output/error [pipes](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/definitions#pipe) and obtain their return codes (e.g. returned status, returned value, etc.). It is a valuable tool to execute external functions and commands in Python instead of manually running them in a terminal application (e.g. video format conversion commands). Thus, it seamlessly integrates external programming into one's Python workflow.

## OpenCV
OpenCV (i.e. Open Source Computer Vision) is an open source computer vision library, originally developed by Intel but now operated by the non-profit Open Source Vision Foundation (OpenCV Foundation). It contains functions for accessing and processing image and video data as well. The `opencv-python` is a library of pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python, i.e. it has binary packages that already contain statically built OpenCV binaries (hence, OpenCV need not be installed in your system on its own).

**NOTE**: `opencv-python` _is to be imported as_ `cv2`.

# Installing FFmpeg
## Install FFmpeg in the system (Windows)
**FFmpeg.org** only provides source code, which means you must seek an FFmpeg build if you want FFmpeg compiled and ready. For a Windows build, check `ffmpeg-release-full.7z` [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds). Notice the `.7z` extension; this is the archive format of [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), a free and open-source file archiver. Hence, to extract the aforementioned FFmpeg build, install 7-Zip and use it on the build by right-clicking on the build's ZIP file and selecting the 7-Zip option (which becomes available once 7-Zip is installed). Once extracted, you get an extracted `ffmpeg-release-full.7z` folder: rename it to `FFmpeg` and move it to the hard-drive's root directory. Then, to make the FFmpeg's functionalities accessible to a script or a command line interface (e.g. through Command Prompt), you must set the [`PATH` variable](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/information.md#path-variable-in-windows) (an environment variable in Windows) to the path of the FFmpeg build's executables. This can be done in Windows command line as follows:

```
setx /m PATH "C:\ffmpeg\bin;%PATH%"
```

<details>
<summary>Click for explanation</summary>
<code>setx</code> creates or modifies environment variables in the user or system environment, without requiring programming or scripting. <code>/m</code> specifies that the variable must be set in the system environment (this must be specified since the default setting is the local environment, i.e. for the current user's environment only). Reference: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx"><code>setx</code> from <b>learn.microsoft.com</b> (documentation)</a>.
<br><br>
<code>PATH</code> is the environment variable which must be reassigned. <code>"C:\ffmpeg\bin;%PATH%"</code> is the value that must be assigned to the <code>PATH</code> variable (to learn more about the use of the percent symbol % in Windows command line to represent variable values, click <a href="https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/information.md#percent-character-in-windows-command-line">here</a>). Here, <code>%PATH%</code> represents the value of the <code>PATH</code> variable, which is a string of folder paths separated by semicolons. Hence, <code>"C:\ffmpeg\bin;%PATH%"</code> is actually a string where the folder path <code>C:\ffmpeg\bin</code> is concatenated (along with a semicolon to separate it from other folder paths) to the current value of the <code>PATH</code> variable, which is itself a string of folder paths separated by semicolons.

Doing this will make `ffmpeg` a usable command.

## Optional use of a Python binding
I used `ffmpeg-python`, but you can also use `python-ffmpeg`, which is a different implementation for a similar purpose. To install `ffmpeg-python`, enter `pip install ffmpeg-python` in the terminal/command prompt (make sure the Python package installed `pip` is installed first). I think most (if not all) such bindings act only as wrappers, which means FFmpeg must be installed in your system anyway.

# Issues with commands through Python's subprocess module
## Issue history
When first trying to run FFmpeg through the Python binding `ffmpeg-python`, the interpreter threw the following error:

Since my video file's given path was correct, I tried running 'dir' to check the working of the `subprocess` module itself:

                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
</pre>
</details>

Now, note that both `dir` and the previous `ffmpeg` commands involve accessing files or folders, and since the error was a `FileNotFoundError`, I tried running a command that does not involve accessing files or folders, namely `getmac`, which displays the MAC address of every network controller on a system. This command worked as intended; this is a hint to the cause of the problem, but I shall pursue this hint later.

## An easy solution
One fix for the `FileNotFoundError` was to use the following:

**For using FFmpeg via the** `ffmpeg-python` **Python binding**:

```python
subprocess.run(['cmd', '/c'])
ffmpeg.input(inputFile).output(outputFile).run()
```

**For the** `dir` **command**:

```python
subprocess.run(['cmd', '/c', ''])
```

Hence, a solution was to prefix the commands with `cmd /c` (note that `cmd` is a command while `/c` is an option within this command); to see information on `cmd`, enter `cmd /?` in Command Prompt. According to this information, `cmd` starts a new instance of the Windows XP command interpreter, whereas `/c` carries out the command specified by the following string and then terminates. This fixed the issue previously seen.

# Use of `sys` in my video processing programs
I aim to pass the file name (without extension) as an argument to a video-processing Python script, so that I can make the script more generalisable while also being able to use the command history to access previous calls to the Python script (without having to re-enter the file name in, for example, a runtime input). To learn more about the `sys` module, click [here](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/blob/main/information.md#sys).

Specifically for my purpose, `sys.argv[0]` gives the first string after the `python` command, which would be the Python file's name. `sys.argv[1]` gives the second string after the `python` command, which would be any argument passed after the Python file's name. Note that all command line arguments are taken as strings.

# OpenCV for video processing in Python
## Obtaining video metadata
There exist constants in `cv2` that refer to video properties (e.g. `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT`). These constants are integers, which means they are indices wherein each index corresponds to a particular property. How these indices can be used to retrieve the metadata of a video is demonstrated in [`read_metadata.py`](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/blob/main/videoProcessing/read_metadata.py).

## `cv2.VideoCapture`
> **Key reference**: [cv::VideoCapture Class Reference (documentation)](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html)

### Retrieving metadata
Use to `.get` method, passing the index corresponding to the desired property, as demonstrated in [`read_metadata.py`](https://github.com/pranigopu/computerVision/blob/main/videoProcessing/read_metadata.py). Note that return values are floating point numbers, even for integer-valued properties like frame count.

### Releasing a `cv2.VideoCapture` object
Suppose `capture` is a `cv2.VideoCapture` object, which means it refers to either a video file or a data steam from a capturing device. Then, `capture.release()` closes the video file or capturing device (note that this method is automatically called when a `cv2.VideoCapture` object is destroyed). This method also deallocates memory and clears `capture` pointer.
